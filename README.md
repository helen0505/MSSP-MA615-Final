Since data sets are so large that the system did not allow me to upload or commit them, I'll just put links here:

# Shiny App
I was not able to publish my Shiny App since it was too large. 

# Summary
I have completed EDA on Average Travel Times vs. Routes on MBTA light rails and heavy rails. Through the plots, people will be able to figure out average travel times in different quarters and compare the results beween different lines. Through my EDA analysis, I had the chance to look at MBTA data as a frequent Green Line rider! The travel times do vary in different quarters, and if I had the chance, I would explore reasons in further studies.

I also made a shiny application based on travel time. I employed 10 pairs of stop on different T lines in two directions. However, I was not able to obtain information on other transits and converting what I got to a map.
